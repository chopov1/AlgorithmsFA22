# AlgorithmsFA22

My name is Mack Pearson-Muggli and this repo contains code for my Algorithms class at columbia college
The project FYshuffle demonstrates my understanding of the fisher yates shuffle. An algorithm used to shuffle values of an array by swapping indexes. It reads text data from the file "TextFile.txt" puts it into an array and shuffles it.

I created an application to demonstarte my knowledge of data structures. In the comments of the code I compare and contrast benefits of both and explain how a map for example might be better then an array in certain circumstances.
